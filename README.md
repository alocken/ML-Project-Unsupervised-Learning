# Machine Learning Project - Unsupervised Learning

### Goal
Gain data insight and communicate these using appropriate visualizations.

## Project Outcomes
- Performed unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset
- Included: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA)

### Project Description:
Utilized unsupervised learning methods on a real-world dataset, using data visualization tools to effectively communicate insights derived from the analysis. The dataset, titled 'Wholesale Data', included details about different products sold by a grocery store.

Project involved:
-	*EDA and pre-processing*
    - imported and cleaned data, 
    - analyzed and visualized relationships between different variables, 
    - explored if there were any missing values, 
    - opportunities for feature engineering, and 
    - handled outliers
-	*Unsupervised learning*
    - performed k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA to identify patterns and group similar data points together
    - determined optimal number of clusters
    - communicated insights gained through EDA/data visualization

### Results 
- Paiplot indicated positive correlation between 'Fresh' and 'Milk', 'Detergents_Paper' and 'Milk', 'Grocery' and 'Milk','Detergents_Paper' and 'Grocery'
- Box Plot identified highly skewed data and supported required to implement log scale to resolve 
- Hierarchical Clustering: used dendrogram to identified optimal number of clusters 
- PCA Explained Variance Ratio per Principal Component - indicated how much variance could be attributed to each principal component with PC1 and PC2 accouting for roughly 60% 

### Challenges
- Outlier detection indicated likelihood of highly skewed data and implemented log scale in response

### Future Goals
- Explore additional future engineering possibilities to identify impact(s) on performance and outputs of unsupervised learning techniques
